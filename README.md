# 🧠 AI Powered Stroke Detection App

This is a **Streamlit application** that uses a **Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify CT scan images into two categories: **Normal** or **Stroke**. The app is designed to assist in the preliminary detection of strokes using medical CT scan images.

## 🔥 Try the App 

You can access the **AI-Powered Stroke Detection App** by clicking the link below:  

🔗 [**Brain Stroke Detection App**](https://brain-stroke-app.streamlit.app/)  

This app uses **deep learning** to analyze Brain CT scan images and detect potential stroke indicators with high accuracy. Upload an image and get an instant prediction!  

## 🖼️ Sample Images for Testing  

To test the app, here are some 📂 [**Sample Test Images**](https://github.com/iaobasa/Brain_stroke_App/tree/main/Sample_Test_Images) available in the repository.  

Download and upload these images to the app for quick testing and evaluation!

##  Features

- **Deep Learning Model**:  
  The application uses a Deep Learning CNN model fine-tuned on a CT scan dataset.

- **Image Classification**:  
  Detects whether a CT scan image indicates a **normal brain** or signs of a **stroke**.
  
- **High Accuracy**:  
  The Deep Learning model achieved an impressive **94% accuracy** on the test dataset, demonstrating its reliability for stroke detection.

- **Interactive Interface**:  
  Built with Streamlit, the app provides a user-friendly interface for image upload and classification.

- **File Support**:  
  Accepts `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` image formats.

## 📂 Dataset

This application uses the **[Brain Stroke CT Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset/data)**, a collection of CT scan images categorized into two classes:  
1. **Normal**: Images of CT scans without signs of a stroke.  
2. **Stroke**: Images of CT scans showing signs of a stroke.

### **Dataset Details**
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset/data)
- **Images**: 1900 CT scan images:
  - **Normal**: 950 images
  - **Stroke**: 950 images
- **Image Dimensions**: Images are in various resolutions but resized to **224x224** pixels during preprocessing for compatibility with the model.
- **File Formats**: `.png`

### **Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Resizing**: All images are resized to `(224, 224)` pixels to match the Deep Learning model's input size.
2. **Channel Conversion**: Images are converted to RGB to ensure compatibility with the pre-trained Deep Learning architecture.
3. **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to the range `[0, 1]` to improve model training performance.

### **Dataset Usage**
- **Training Data**: 70% of the dataset (split using `train_test_split`) is used for model training.
- **Test Data**: 30% of the dataset is reserved for evaluating the model's performance.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add more detailed stroke classification (e.g., ischemic vs. hemorrhagic).
- Incorporate additional datasets for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Sharing, AWS, or Heroku).
